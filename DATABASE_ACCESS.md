# ChromaDB Database Access Control

## üîê Security Implementation

This repository implements **environment-based access control** for the ChromaDB historical photo analysis database.

### For Repository Downloaders

‚ùå **You cannot access the database without authorization.**

When you clone this repository and try to use ChromaDB features, you will see:

```
‚ùå ChromaDB Access Denied: CHROMADB_ACCESS_KEY not found in environment variables.
   This database requires authorized access. Please contact the administrator
   to obtain the required .env file with proper credentials.
```

### What You Need

1. **Contact the administrator** (repository owner)
2. **Request access** to the photo analysis database
3. **Receive authorized .env file** with proper credentials
4. **Replace .env.template** with the provided .env file

### What's Protected

- ‚úÖ **670 historical photos** analysis data
- ‚úÖ **AI-generated descriptions** and metadata  
- ‚úÖ **ChromaDB vector database** with embeddings
- ‚úÖ **Search functionality** and semantic analysis
- ‚úÖ **All stored analysis results**

### For Authorized Users

If you have been provided with the correct `.env` file:

1. Place it in the project root directory
2. The system will automatically validate your access
3. You'll see: `‚úÖ ChromaDB Access Granted: Using key xxxxxxxx...xxxx`

### Technical Details

- **Access Key**: 32-byte cryptographically secure token
- **Validation**: Minimum 16 character length requirement
- **Environment**: Must be present in `CHROMADB_ACCESS_KEY` variable
- **Scope**: Protects all ChromaDB operations and data access

### Administrator Notes

To grant access to new users:
1. Share your `.env` file securely
2. Users replace their `.env.template` with your file
3. Access is granted automatically upon restart

**Security Level**: üîê **High** - Database inaccessible without proper credentials
